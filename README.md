## Testing

Download the release and extract it wherever you want, then launch 'wwe-dl' (for MAC users : Mouse on the app > CTRL + Right Click > Open, otherwise Apple won't let you launch it because it's not an official app).

A default account is already provided, juste use the "use saved credentials" option in the homepage.

Here is a couple of links for testing the app :
